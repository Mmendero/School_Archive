Over the wintry
Forest, winds howl in rage
With no leaves to blow
-1
life’s little, our heads
sad. Redeemed and wasting clay
this chance. Be of use
-1
Delightful display
Snowdrops bow their pure white heads
To the sun's glory
-1
Strokes of affection
Light and tenderly expressed
Keep love’s bonds so strong
-1
Calm as a river
Tranquility in my heart
Blue summer skies reign
-1
I was in fire,
The room was dark and somber
I sleep peacefully
